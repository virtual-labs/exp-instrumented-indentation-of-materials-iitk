      "question": "1. What is instrumented indentation technique?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "That measures hardness and Young’s modulus during indentation of material",
        "b": "That provides only hardness of material during indentation of material",
        "c": "That provides only elastic modulus during indentation of material ",
        "d": "That records instantaneous load vs displacement during indentation of material"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Measurement is eventual, but the recording of instantaneous displacement at applied load makes it ‘instrumented’ indentation.",
        "b": "Measurement is eventual, but the recording of instantaneous displacement at applied load makes it ‘instrumented’ indentation.",
        "c": "Measurement is eventual, but the recording of instantaneous displacement at applied load makes it ‘instrumented’ indentation.",
